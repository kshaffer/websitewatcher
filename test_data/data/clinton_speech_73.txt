Excerpts of Remarks in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania
b'Below are excerpts of Hillary Clinton\'s prepared remarks for this afternoon\'s "Solutions for America" rally in Harrisburg, PA: After seven years of an energy policy written by and for the oil companies - with help from Dick Cheney - oil has now reached $107 a barrel - and gas prices in some areas are approaching $4 a gallon. I understand Senator Obama is talking about energy today, right here in Pennsylvania. And that\'s great. But talking about problems is easy. Solving problems is hard. And speeches are no substitute for solutions. Speeches won\'t lower gas prices, stop climate change, or lessen our dependence on oil from Saudi Arabia. The true test comes when it\'s time to match rhetoric with results. And unfortunately, we\'ve seen that Senator Obama\'s promises and speeches are often just words. On the campaign trail, Senator Obama talks about clean energy. But in the Senate, he voted for Dick Cheney\'s energy bill loaded with new tax breaks for oil companies. When he faced a tough choice, his support for a clean energy future turned out to be just words. It\'s like how he talks about fixing NAFTA. But his top economic adviser assured the Canadian government that he wouldn\'t really follow through. His position? Just words. Senator Obama promises to withdraw from Iraq within 16 months. But his top foreign policy adviser said he\'s not really going to rely on that plan. I guess that plan is just words, too. We need a president who will solve problems. Who will fight for our families long after the speeches are over and the cameras are gone. That\'s the choice in this campaign: Solutions you can rely on - versus words you can\'t.'
